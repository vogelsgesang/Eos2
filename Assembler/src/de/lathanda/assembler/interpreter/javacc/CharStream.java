/**
 * This interface describes a character stream that maintains line and
 * column number positions of the characters.  It also has the capability
 * to backup the stream to some extent.  An implementation of this
 * interface is used in the TokenManager implementation generated by
 * JavaCCParser.
 *
 * All the methods except backup can be implemented in any fashion. backup
 * needs to be implemented correctly for the correct operation of the lexer.
 * Rest of the methods are all used to get information like line number,
 * column number and the String that constitutes a token and are not used
 * by the lexer. Hence their implementation won't affect the generated lexer's
 * operation.
